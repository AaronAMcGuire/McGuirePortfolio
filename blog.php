<a href='blog/underthehood.php' title='Aarons approach to website performance optimisation.'><h2>A look under the hood: Website performance and optimisation</h2></a><span class='line'></span><h3>Code Validation</h3>
<p>Validation of code is one of the most common practices to follow – allowing the web to be truly accessible to all!  Yet there are still plenty of websites that have simple validation errors rendering the whole website a UX disaster. Every website I make, I try my utmost best to ensure every element is valid, semantic and accessible. A few ways I validated my code during the development of this website were as follows: </p>

<a href='blog/developmentprocess.php' title='Aarons process of development.'><h2>The best development process?</h2></a><span class='line'></span><h3>Research:</h3><p>Considered the most important aspect of the whole project, research was my first port of call. Like any other project I start out by looking at possible competition. These competitors ranged from industry professionals to fellow students. I looking at websites such as Awwwards and Cssdesignawards to find the ‘best’ websites out there. Coming across some awe-inspiring websites such as wwrk but also websites that simply lacked usability. It’s very important to check the usability of these websites as more commonly than not these websites look fantastic but need an operations manual to use them ‘correctly’. A good technique adopted along side a competitor analysis is to analyse possible design trends – This helps later on in the design phase. <figure>

<a href='blog/keepupdigital.php'  title='Aarons struggle keeping up in the digital industry'><h2>Digital Industry: Staying relevant as a student</h2></a><span class='line'></span><p>Every now and then things change – it’s a given, a way of life but when those changes mean your reading product documentations every two minutes and constantly adapting your skills, is the digital world really all worth it? Well, of course! Who else is going to make websites that adhere to every WCAG guideline ever invented? As it stands there are double the staff aged between 31 and 41 in the digital industry than those between 18 and 24 (Digital Skills Festival, 2016). Personally this for me was a huge shock, as there’s whole companies dedicated to developing products for younger people and yet there’s a lack of those people within the industry. <figure>
